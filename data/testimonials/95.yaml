text: "Together with Franka Emika GmbH, Objective Partner AG is developing a pay-as-you-go/asset as a service solution for a robot that autonomously performs rapid tests for the new coronavirus. This will make airports, for example, even safer in the future. We are developing the software services and digital twins for the rapid test robot with Eclipse BaSyx."
