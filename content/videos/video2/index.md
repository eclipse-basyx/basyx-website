Off-the-shelf (OTS) components are designed and implemented for users which don't want to run BaSyx source code, instead it is possible to run it directly as <b>Docker</b> containers. These OTS components are based on the Eclipse BaSyx Java implementation. 

In this video, the main OTS components are introduced and explained:
- how to start the components
- how to configure their features using property files
- how to configure their features using environment variables
