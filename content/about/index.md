	Eclipse BaSyx is the open source platform for next generation automation. It implements key concepts defined by Platform Industrie 4.0, such as the Asset Administration Shell as standardized digital twin.  
	Our mission is to provide a free software platform that enables all interested parties, large and small companies, research institutes, academia, and interested persons, 
	to participate in and to shape the fourth industrial revolution. We believe that the availability of a free reference technology platform is a key success factor for the 
	Industrie 4.0.
	</p>	
	
	<p class="lead" align="justify">
	Eclipse BaSyx therefore provides common and re-useable off-the shelf Industrie 4.0 components and SDKs (Java, C# and C++) that support the implementation of new Industrie 4.0 software components 
	to enable rapid development of Industrie 4.0 solutions. BaSyx furthermore supports reference application scenarios for common 
	Industrie 4.0 challenges such as a changeable production to enable individualized goods, leveraging big data analytics and connecting heterogeneous devices and systems while minimizing 
	downtime and other associated costs.

	<!--<p class="lead" align="justify">
	Eclipse BaSyx is actively supported by the <a href="https://www.basys40.de/" title=""> BaSys 4.2 </a> (Homepage, in German) research project, which is 
	funded by the German Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF, grant no. 01IS16022). BaSys 4.2 researches and specifies key concepts of Industrie 4.0, participates in standardization activities, and integrates existing 
	standards and technologies into an Industrie 4.0 middleware.
