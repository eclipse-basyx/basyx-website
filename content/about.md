Eclipse BaSyx is the open source platform for next generation automation. As a reference technology  platform, the BaSyx project enables large and small industries, research institutes, academia, and interested persons, to participate in the fourth industrial revolution.
</p>
<p class="lead">
 The platform enables rapid development of Industrie 4.0 solutions by providing common Industrie 4.0 components and an SDK that supports the development of new components. The Eclipse BaSyx platform will provide reference application scenarios for common Industrie 4.0 challenges.

 These challenges include implementing changeable production to enable individualized goods, exploiting big data analytics and connecting heterogenous devices and systems while minimizing downtime and other associated costs. 
</p>

<p class="lead">
The BaSyx platform provides tools to meet these challenges by providing the following components.
<ul class="lead">
	<li>The plant level consists of high-level plant components that manage, optimize, and monitor the production.</li></br>
	<li>The middleware level consists of re-useable Industrie 4.0 components that implement required generic, and plant-independent capabilities for Industrie 4.0 production lines. Registry and Discovery services, protocol gateways, and Asset Administration Shell providers for example reside on the middleware level.</li></br>
	<li>Device level: The device level consists of automation devices that offer a BaSys 4.0 conforming interface. Bridging devices that implement BaSys 4.0 conforming interfaces for field devices that do not provide a conforming interface by themselves are part of the device level as well.</li></br>
	<li>Field level: The field level consists of automation devices, sensors, and actuators without a specific BaSys conforming interface.</li>
	
</ul>
