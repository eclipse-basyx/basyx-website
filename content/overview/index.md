    Making the Industry 4.0 happen requires great efforts and strong cooperation between research, academia, industry, the public, and standardization bodies. And it requires an implementation – the code that runs the world of manufacturing. Eclipse BaSyx emerged as commonly used Industry 4.0 middleware and became one of the first implementations of the Asset Administration Shell (AAS), even before it was a standard for digital twins. This is why Eclipse BaSyx is part of the code that enables digitization of manufacturing – that connects machines and IT systems – that runs our world.

Many important ideas and standards were and are created under the umbrella of the Platform Industrie 4.0. Why not having a look on current result and discussion papers? Even the first revisions of the Asset Administration Shell (AAS) were created under the umbrella of Platform Industry 4.0, which turned out to be one of the most important assets in digitizing manufacturing. </p>

The IDTA also develops Asset Administration Shell sub models, important data structures that structure Asset Data and enable its use across borders of a single company. Under the umbrella of the IDTA, several working groups have been created that bring industry experts, researches, and end-users together. The working groups focus on the development of for example AAS sub models, reference implementations of the Asset Administration Shell, but also on AAS trainings</p>
