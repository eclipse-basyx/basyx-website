The Rover (SW: [Rover Software](https://app4mc-rover.github.io/rover-docs/), HW: [Rover Hardware](https://wiki.eclipse.org/APP4MC/Rover)) has been updated to version V03. This includes several migrations of tasks to AGL services and applications, as well major improvements to the Rover's chassis, that provides a more modular structure since components can be flexibly clipped to different positions without the need of screws.
The following implementations are though on our roadmap for the next release:

* ACC
* Parking
* Marker recognition (using OpenCV)
* Rover-follow application
* ....
