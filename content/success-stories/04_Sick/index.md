## Creating a harmonized data space for an efficient intra-logistics

SICK is one of the world's leading suppliers of sensor solutions for automation applications in factories, logistics and processes. 
As a technology and market leader, SICK creates the basis for safe and efficient control of processes, protection of people from accidents and prevention of environmental damage with sensor intelligence and application solutions.

SICK controls its intra-logistics using event-based dynamic dispatching with the aim of increasing efficiency and flexibility. To achieve this goal, asset interfaces must be harmonized and data silos must be broken down to create an integrated and harmonized data space.

SICK quickly realized the benefits of implementing Asset Administration Shells using Eclipse BaSyx for this purpose. Working closely with Fraunhofer IESE, SICK defined their own submodel templates and used the Eclipse BaSyx Java SDK to implement an AAS generator tailored to SICK's needs. By using the various components and features of BaSyx, SICK was able to set up the Asset Administration Shell for productive use within a few days.

As a result of the project, SICK achieved an AAS-based logistics dispatch system that breaks down data silos and creates harmonized interfaces for assets. This not only enabled them to achieve their goals, but also to benefit from other features of the AAS ecosystem, such as the AAS GUI and easy integration with other AAS-based solutions. The implemented system is now being used in a number of factories, enabling further use cases such as asset and factory monitoring.
