cover_summary: "Flexibility and faster changes with Eclipse BaSyx – ZF Friedrichshafen AG is using Eclipse BaSyx to react quickly to changes. ZF experts integrated Eclipse BaSyx in a prototype manufacturing line, including digital twins and lot size one manufacturing. Now, changing the automated manufacturing process can happen in only a few minutes. This efficient adaptation enables the efficient production also of smallest lot sizes. Furthermore, the integration of new devices into the process is now 30% percent faster, compared to the traditional automation used before."

## More Flexible and faster commissioning with Eclipse BaSyx

ZF Friedrichshafen AG took the chance to use the most advanced Industry 4.0 operating system when updating their prototype manufacturing line. Now, changing the automated manufacturing process can happen in only a few minutes. This efficient adaptation enables the efficient production also of smallest lot sizes. Furthermore, the integration of new devices into the process is now 30% percent faster, compared to the traditional automation used before. This yielded the following benefits:

<ul>
  <li><b>More flexible, faster, and cost-effective production </b>
  
  Faster changes yield fewer down times. With eclipse BaSyx, changes can be introduced into manufacturing processes with no downtimes at all. Driven by the current changeover in the electromobility sector, an efficiently changeable production is a key enabler.
  </li>
  
  <li><b>Changeability as a basis for restructuring </b>
  
  Eclipse BaSyx was integrated into the prototype manufacturing in Schweinfurt. Previously commissioning, when using conventional technology, did take around 14 days, now it takes about 10 minutes.</li>
  
  <li><b>Simplified retrofiting</b>
  
  Not all devices are from the same generation, and not all of them speak the same language. Eclipse BaSyx integrates with many protocols thanks to its data bridge. This enables rapid integration of manufacturing devices.
  </li>
  
  <li><b>Digital twins without programming experience</b>

  A major advantage of BaSyx is that off-the-shelf components which make it easy to set up digital twin environments without programming experience. And Eclipse BaSyx conforms to the relevant standards, for example for the Asset Administration Shell. 
  </li>
</ul>
