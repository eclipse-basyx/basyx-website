    <div class=""><h2>Realization of service-based production with Eclipse BaSyx</h2></div>
    <p>Realization of service-based production with Eclipse BaSyx - Ellenberger GmbH & co. KG is a mechanical parts manufacturing company located in Kaiserslautern. They need to quickly process large numbers of customer orders with different lot sizes based on their capacities and available resources. Eclipse BaSyx Asset Administration Shells were used to integrate an ERP system that automates the decision-making process.</p>
    <p>Ellenberger did use Eclipse BaSyx to create Digital Twins for manufacturing islands, machines, and tools and thus enable semi-automatic resource-based feasibility checks based on real-time production data. Information modelling with Digital Twins is done via the implementation of the standardized asset administration shell provided by Eclipse BaSyx. The business logic is mapped via the ERP system of Odion.</p>
