As experts for Eclipse BaSyx, they are happy to support all your automation needs. One of the major solutions provided by Meta-Level for industrial automation is the AAS Designer.

The AAS Designer is a web-based tool that supports users in creating Asset Administration Shells and associated sub models easily and quickly. It also supports management and sharing of AAS. The AAS Designer guides users through the entire process of creating an AAS while already catching possible errors. The expert mode for skilled users enables creation and editing of AAS without restrictions. Sharing of AAS within the same company is also a function of AAS Designer.
